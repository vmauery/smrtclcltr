Ideas for future development
 * Support for different 'displays'
   * Non-interactive (read input, print final value, no extras)
   * Simple with or without readline
   * TUI with status and extra info
     * Show modes rad/deg, polar/rect
	 * Show error messages
	 * Memory usage? CPU usage?
 * Date/time support (waiting for C++20 libs to get implemented)
 * Tab completion of function names
 * Better parsing of input (spirit? or maybe just more regexes?)
 * Constants library (interactive lookup for lesser-known constants)
 * More functions (long list)
 * N-d vector support
   * parse / cross / dot / add / subtract / scaler
 * Array support
   * parse / add / subtract / inv / det / mult
 * Variable store/recall support
 * Scripting? Like the HP language? That might be too much...
 * Saved state?
 * Modes
   * Modular arithmetic mode
   * Polar/rect mode
   * Fixed bit math (for debugging C math issues, show over/under-flow bit)
 * Graphing? WTF? That's fancy.
 * Eval of formula ('x^2+2*x+3' 3 $x store eval)?
 * Auto-downcast support (choose least-complex type for no data loss)
   * may be lossy if precision is low... mpf to mpq/mpz might be a lie
   * mpf -> mpz if no fractional part
   * mpf -> mpq for perfect fractions?
   * mpq -> mpq for denominator = 1
   * mpc -> mpf for imaginary = 0
 * Units. A work in progress.
